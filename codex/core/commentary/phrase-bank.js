/**
 * Procedural commentary phrase bank for CODEx heuristic commentary.
 *
 * Instead of static bridge/closer sentences, each entry provides:
 * - concept: the abstract theme label
 * - citations: static quotes from public-domain criticism (Project Gutenberg)
 * - aspects: noun phrases naming specific facets of the concept
 * - criteria: noun phrases describing what the heuristic judges
 *
 * Shared template vocabulary (verbs, quality tiers, verdict phrases, scopes)
 * lives in TEMPLATE_VOCAB. The commentary builder uses these ingredients to
 * procedurally generate bridge and closer sentences, then scores candidates
 * with a bigram Markov model.
 *
 * MODEL_CORPUS provides exemplar sentences for Markov model training,
 * establishing the bigram transitions of good commentary register.
